# Stock-Price-Prediction-and-Back-Testing-
In this project, I conducted independent research on time series data analysis for Apple stock price forecasting. Utilized the traditional machine learning model, ARIMA, as a benchmark. Implemented a deep learning model, LSTM. Backtesting is conducted to evaluate the performance of a specified investment strategy based on predicted data from LSTM.
